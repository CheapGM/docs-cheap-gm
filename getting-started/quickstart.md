# Quickstart !

## SAY GM&#x20;

* **Connect your wallet** – Click _Connect Wallet_ and choose MetaMask or WalletConnect.
* **Say GM** – Hit the green **Say GM** button to send your GM for the day.
* **Track your progress** – View streaks, total GMs, XP, and leaderboard position.

## Deploy a Smart Contract

**Deploy a Smart Contract –** CheapGM lets you deploy pre-built smart contracts directly from the app without writing code.

1. **Go to “Deploy SC” tab** – In the main menu, select the **Deploy Smart Contract** section.
2. **Select the network** – Choose the blockchain where you want the contract deployed.
3. **Confirm in your wallet** – Approve the transaction in MetaMask or WalletConnect.
4. **View your contract** – Once deployed, you’ll see the contract address and can interact with it instantly.
